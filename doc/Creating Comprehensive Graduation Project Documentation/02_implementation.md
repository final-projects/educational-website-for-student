# Chapter 2: Implementation Details

## 2.1 Technology Stack

This educational website was developed using a modern technology stack chosen for its robustness, scalability, and developer productivity. The core components include:

*   **Backend Framework:** Laravel (Version inferred from `composer.json`, likely 10 or 11). Laravel is a popular open-source PHP web framework known for its elegant syntax, extensive features (like Eloquent ORM, Blade templating engine, built-in security features), and strong community support. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, promoting organized and maintainable code.
*   **Programming Language:** PHP (Version compatible with the chosen Laravel version, typically PHP 8.1+). PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language well-suited for web development.
*   **Database:** While not explicitly defined in the provided file list without database configuration files (`.env` or `config/database.php`), Laravel projects typically use MySQL or PostgreSQL as the relational database management system (RDBMS) to store application data like user information, courses, and levels. Eloquent ORM abstracts database interactions.
*   **Frontend Technologies:**
    *   HTML5: For structuring the web pages.
    *   CSS3: For styling the user interface. The presence of `resources/css/app.css` and potentially frameworks like Tailwind CSS (often included with Laravel Breeze/Jetstream starter kits) or Bootstrap suggests standard CSS usage, possibly preprocessed.
    *   JavaScript: For client-side interactivity. Files like `resources/js/app.js` and `bootstrap.js` indicate its use, potentially incorporating libraries or frameworks like Alpine.js or Vue.js/React if a starter kit like Jetstream was used, although the basic structure suggests a simpler setup, possibly using vanilla JS or jQuery via `bootstrap.js`.
*   **Web Server:** Typically deployed using Apache or Nginx.
*   **Dependency Management:** Composer for PHP packages and NPM (Node Package Manager) or Yarn for frontend assets.

## 2.2 Project Setup and Architecture

Setting up the project involves cloning the repository, installing dependencies using Composer (`composer install`) and NPM (`npm install && npm run dev` or `build`), configuring the environment (`.env` file, including database credentials and application key), and running database migrations (`php artisan migrate`).

The application adheres to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:

*   **Models (`app/Models/`):** Represent the data structure and interact with the database (e.g., `User.php`, likely models for `Course`, `Level`, etc., exist here). Eloquent models handle database operations.
*   **Views (`resources/views/`):** Define the presentation layer using the Blade templating engine. Files like `welcome.blade.php`, `dashboard.blade.php`, and various files within `admin`, `auth`, `components`, `layouts`, etc., render the HTML sent to the user.
*   **Controllers (`app/Http/Controllers/`):** Handle user requests, process data (interacting with Models), and load the appropriate Views. Controllers for authentication (`Auth/`), admin functions (`Admin/`), courses, levels, etc., reside here.
*   **Routes (`routes/`):** Define the application's endpoints (URLs) and map them to specific Controller actions (`web.php` for web routes, `api.php` for API routes if any, `auth.php` for authentication routes).

This separation of concerns makes the application modular, easier to test, and maintain.

## 2.3 Key Features Implemented

Based on the file structure analysis, the following key features have been implemented:

*   **Dual Authentication System:** Separate login/registration and dashboard areas for regular users (students) and administrators, likely managed through middleware and distinct route groups (`routes/web.php`, `routes/auth.php`, potentially admin-specific routes).
*   **Admin Dashboard:** A dedicated interface (`resources/views/admin/dashboard/`) for administrators to manage the platform.
*   **Course Management (Admin):** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for courses (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/CourseController.php`, `resources/views/admin/dashboard/courses/`).
*   **Level Management (Admin):** CRUD functionality for educational levels or modules (`app/Http/Controllers/Admin/LevelController.php`, `resources/views/admin/levels/`).
*   **Student Management (Admin):** Ability for administrators to view and potentially manage student accounts (`resources/views/admin/students/`).
*   **Student Dashboard:** A dashboard for logged-in students (`resources/views/dashboard/`) to view information, likely including assigned or available courses (`resources/views/dashboard/courses/show.blade.php`).
*   **Profile Management:** Users (both students and admins) can update their profile information and password (`resources/views/profile/`, `resources/views/admin/profile/`).
*   **Responsive Design:** Utilization of frontend frameworks/CSS likely ensures the interface adapts to different screen sizes (implied by standard Laravel practices).
